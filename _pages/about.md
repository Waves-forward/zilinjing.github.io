I am a first-year doctoral student advised by [Prof. Shalmali Joshi](https://shalmalijoshi.github.io/reAIM/) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University.

Previously, I got my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Shuang Li](https://shuangli01.github.io/) and [Prof. Hongyuan Zha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n1DQMIsAAAAJ&hl=en). During Jan 2023 to Aug 2023, I am also an international visiting student at Yale University through [Y-VISP](https://yvisp.yale.edu/)

You can reach me via email at `zj2398{at}columbia.edu`.
